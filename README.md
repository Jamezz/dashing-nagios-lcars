# dashing-nagios-lcars
An LCARS dashboard with added plugin to spacify your Nagios experience! NOTE: This is still a work in progress. There is much to do and even more to clean up.

Credit goes to https://github.com/Aricwithana/LCARS-SDK for the wonderful HTML5 SDK.


This dashboard uses the Dashing framework. Check them out at http://dashing.io
